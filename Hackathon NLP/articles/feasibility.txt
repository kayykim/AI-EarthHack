Types of Feasibility



TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY
This study centres on the technological resources available to the company. It helps businesses determine whether technical resources are sufficient for the project and whether the technical team is capable of translating concepts into operational systems. The hardware, software, and other technical requirements of the proposed system are also assessed for technical viability.

ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY
This study usually includes a cost-benefit analysis of the project, which aids businesses in determining the project’s viability, cost and benefits before allocating financial resources. It also boosts project credibility by assisting decision-makers in recognising the proposed project’s favourable economic advantages to the organisation.

LEGAL FEASIBILITY
This investigation reviews aspects of the proposed project that may be in violation of laws such as zoning requirements, data protection legislation or social media laws. Assuming a business wants to build a new office building in a specific location, a feasibility study may reveal that the company’s planned location is not suitable for that type of business. That organisation has just saved a lot of time and work by recognising that their proposal was not feasible early on.

OPERATIONAL FEASIBILITY
This research study is to see if, and to what extent, the organisation’s needs can be met by completing the project. Operational feasibility studies also examine how a project plan complies with the criteria established during the system development requirements analysis phase.

SCHEDULING FEASIBILITY
This inspection is critical for project success; after all, if a project is not completed on time, it will fail. An organisation predicts the amount of time it will take to execute a project when scheduling feasibility.

 

Importance of Sustainability and Feasibility
Sustainability strengthens our quality of life while also safeguarding our environment and natural resources for future generations. In the business sector, sustainability is linked to a company’s holistic strategy, which considers everything from manufacturing to logistics to customer service. Going green and sustainable is not just good for business; it also enhances the long-term advantages of an environmental emphasis.

FEASIBILITY IS CRUCIAL BECAUSE IT ENABLES PROJECT MANAGERS IN DETERMINING THE FEASIBILITY OF A PROJECT OR BUSINESS ENDEAVOUR BY IDENTIFYING THE VARIABLES THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO ITS SUCCESS. THE ANALYSIS ALSO DEPICTS THE POSSIBLE RETURN ON INVESTMENT AS WELL AS ANY THREATS TO THE VENTURE’S SUCCESS.

How Sustainability and Feasibility are Interlinked
Climate change and rising wealth disparity have emerged as two major dangers to modern living standards, peace and democracy. In most policy agendas, these two issues are addressed independently. Well, to manage a fair low-carbon transition, a new generation of innovative approaches has been offered. In this spirit, a dynamic microscopic simulation model is always needed to do feasible study for analysing the long-term implications of three scenarios: green growth, social equality measures and de-growth. Green growth, which is based on technological advancement and environmental laws, significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions at the price of growing economic disparity and unemployment. Direct labour market interventions that result in environmental performance comparable to green growth while maintaining economic development are among the strategies for the social equality scenario. Despite the implementation of a wealth tax, the de-growth scenario adds a fall in consumption and exports, and achieves a bigger reduction in emissions and inequality with a higher public deficit. We believe that revolutionary social policies are both economically and politically feasible and can combine social prosperity with low carbon emissions.

SDGs and the Feasibility of Sustainable Development
Adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015, the 17 ‘Sustainable Development Goals’ (SDGs) are the blueprint for achieving a better and more sustainable society for all by 2030. These objectives are a rallying cry for action to solve a slew of global issues, including poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation and justice.



The best way to predict the future is to create it, and feasibility helps in making strategies that help in creating a sustainable future. Feasibility and sustainability are intertwined. Feasibility aids in the analysis of facts in order to make long- term, sustainable judgments while keeping the goal in mind. These SDGs were formed only as a result of the feasibility research, as the outcomes of this study only assisted in making more possible decisions that support sustainability.

Will SDGs be Relevant Post-pandemic?
Only if governments recast the Goals to be part of the fabric of people’s lives can the SDGs remain relevant during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. The SDGs can survive and even thrive feasibly, as they address the dire situation faced by many communities across the world, including people with disabilities, in the same way that the Goals arose from stories at the grassroots level around the world.

Conclusion
Overall, sustainable development is feasible, or we may argue that sustainability and feasibility go hand in hand. Global development and conservation goals together are indeed possible. We can minimise our exploitation of natural capital while encouraging economic growth and can also confront climate change. The human species is the most unstable and possibly disruptive element in the design. Humans, using contemporary technology, can cause far-reaching and irrevocable changes in the environment, whether purposefully or accidentally. If left to its own devices, the environment can sustain life for millions of years.

‘No matter how complicated global issues appear to be, we are the ones who created them. They can’t possibly be beyond our ability to resolve.’

Sustainable project management encompasses several dimensions. One key dimension is the integration of social, environmental, and economic perspectives into business activities . Another dimension is the alignment of project management processes with sustainability principles, such as resource management, life cycle orientation, stakeholder engagement, and organizational learning . Additionally, sustainable project management involves combining the principles of sustainable management theory with established project management processes and knowledge areas . Control practices play a crucial role in sustainable project management, with a holistic control package that includes indicators and mechanisms for different sustainability dimensions . Finally, the adoption of sustainable practices in project management can lead to reduced costs, increased opportunities and profits, and overall organizational success, although it requires additional commitment and resources .

Fundamentals of a Feasibility Study 
WHAT IS A FEASIBILITY STUDY AND WHY DO YOU NEED ONE? 
Taking an idea from concept to viable cooperative takes many steps. None more valuable or 
important than the feasibility study. In the section you will learn the key concepts to allow you to 
formulate the idea and subject it to rigorous analysis to identify opportunities and challenges that 
will make the cooperative successful. 
A feasibility study should provide a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the market, 
operational, technical, managerial and financial aspects of your business concept or opportunity. A 
comprehensive study can then evolve into the market-driven strategic plan that is the road map for 
all subsequent decisions. 
A feasibility study provides cooperative project committees with an understanding of the viability of 
a business concept. 
A viable business concept must: create or meet a consumer’s 
need, provide a competitive advantage over a competitor’s 
product or service, provide superior delivery characteristics 
and provide a rate of return on investment that is acceptable 
to the investor (s). 
When the feasibility study is completed, the steering committee first 
needs to consider its comprehensiveness and accuracy, rather than 
immediately focus on its recommendations. It is appropriate to 
challenge and question the assumptions and conclusions, and not 
accept the recommendations at face value. 
 Critical 
Thinking 
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FEASIBILITY STUDY AND A BUSINESS PLAN? 
A feasibility study is not a business plan. Rather, it provides an assessment of the viability of the 
business under consideration 
The business plan focuses on what steps are required to be completed if it is decided to go ahead 
with the proposed business launch. The feasibility study, however, identifies and analyzes several 
product or service alternatives and recommends the best business model. 
THE LIFE CYCLE OF A BUSINESS 
The life cycle of a business refers to the key stages (start up, growth, maturity and decline) that 
occur over the life of a business. Each stage has its own unique challenges and opportunities that 
must be taken into consideration. The business plan should describe a specific strategy for how to 
deal effectively with each stage. 
The following provides a description of the four main stages of a business life cycle: 
1. Start Up 
In the start-up phase, the product and demand for it is under development. Sales are 
generally low, and earnings may even be negative. Competition may slowly encroach on 
earnings during this stage, as other businesses become aware of the market potential. At this 
stage, demand for the new product or service must be created, requiring intensive marketing 
campaigns and promotions. There is risk at this stage. Will consumers accept the product or 
service being offered at the price required? 
2. Growth Stage 
In the growth stage, there are increasing sales as the business grows into new markets, and 
costs fall due to economies of scale, allowing profitability to increase. Within this stage, 
marketing risk decreases as consumer acceptance and consumer brand loyalty increases. The 
risk in the growth stage is related to the inevitable increase in competition from new 
entrants. 
3. Maturity 
In this stage, businesses in the industry are becoming more efficient. Those who are more 
efficient earn a competitive advantage over those who are not. At this stage, however, 
competition and/or alternative product promotion can be aggressive. The risk in this stage is 
that increased competition may result in slowing growth rates 
Decline 
In the stage of decline, the market has become saturated, the technology changes or 
consumer tastes have moved on. Sales volume declines if the product or service has not kept 
up with those changes, or if the industry has moved on to the next thing. Companies in this 
position may sell production assets that are no longer required, move to areas that offer 
reduced facility and/or labour costs, withdraw from that market, or merge with other 
companies. 
KEYS TO BUSINESS SUCCESS 
A great business idea is not enough. For a cooperative to turn a great idea into a viable business, a 
sound business model must be in place. 
1.) A sound business model drives the business to: 
 Management - build an experienced management team with a broad range of skills, and 
seek collaborative decision making that uses all those skills. 
 Operations Management – create a high-quality product or service, at a price point 
where profit can be sustained 
 Generate Sales – offer products or services that consumers will purchase at a price that 
allow the business to be viable. 
 Record a Profit – allows for pricing and delivery cost to allow the business to be profitable, 
even when the per-unit price decreases. 
 Service Debt – provide for a way to compensate the capital providers for the business’s 
use of the capital. Regardless of the source, the owners of the capital will want a return on 
their investment in the business. 
 Provide Residual Income – allow for the business to generate residual income, which is 
the amount of profit that remains once all investment costs have been removed. These are 
the funds to be retained in the business for future growth, or returned to the member 
through patronage dividends. 
 Financial Practices – allows for a solid financial planning function and a good 
understanding of critical financial measures and indicators. It must also have the capacity to 
understand what the financial statements are showing, including important financial ratios 
For many cooperative steering committees, cooperative investors and 
financial institutions reviewing a feasibility plan, the management team 
is the most important component of the plan. An effective management 
team should have skills in the following areas: 
 Marketing 
 Financial management and finance 
 Operations management and appropriate technology 
management (depending on the industry) 
 People management 
 Successful experience in the business’s core industry and markets 
 Critical 
Thinking 
KEYS TO BUSINESS FAILURES 
New businesses are constantly coming into the market, providing every imaginable product, service 
or good. Some firms survive, others grow, and substantial numbers of new firms fail. 
Information provided by Statistics Canada reveals that that it is not the absence of sophisticated 
business strategies that leads many young firms to fail, but rather skill deficiencies in core areas, 
specifically those related to management and financing.

IDEA ASSESSMENT 
Great business ideas can come from many sources, but generally they are a result of creative 
thinking that reflects new insights into an existing product or service. Every great business idea 
provides an opportunity to create economic value for the business. 
The idea must meet or create a customer need, provide a competitive advantage, allow for 
appropriate time-to-market, and provide a reasonable return to investors. 
A useful tool to provide an assessment of a business idea is a SWOT analysis created by the Boston 
Consulting Group. A SWOT analysis is a strategic planning method used to evaluate the Strengths, 
Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats that prevail at a particular time, for a project or business
venture. 
 Internal factors – The strengths and weaknesses internal to the organization. 
o Strengths: attributes of the organization that is helpful to achieving the objective. 
o Weaknesses: attributes of the organization that is harmful to achieving the objective. 
 External factors – The opportunities and threats presented by the external environment to 
the organization 
o Opportunities: external conditions those are helpful to achieving the objective. 
o Threats: external conditions which could do damage to the business's performance or 
work against achieving the objective. 
Within an organization, features that may represent strengths with respect to one objective may be 
weaknesses for another objective. The factors may include personnel, finance, manufacturing 
capabilities, and so on. 
External factors may include macroeconomic matters, technological change, legislation, and sociocultural changes, as well as changes in the marketplace or competitive position. 
The results of a SWOT are often presented in the form of a matrix. 
The next steps in planning for achievement of the selected objective can follow from whatever is 
revealed in the SWOT. 
The plan needs to show how the business will use its strengths, mitigate or backfill its weaknesses, 
seize opportunities and defuse or dodge threats. 
A SWOT analysis is just one method of analysis, and has its own weaknesses. For example, it may 
tend to persuade companies to compile lists, rather than think about what is actually important in 
achieving objectives. It may also present the resulting lists uncritically and without clear 
prioritization so that, for example, weak opportunities may appear to balance strong threats. 
It is prudent not to prematurely eliminate any candidate SWOT entry. The importance of each item 
generated will be revealed by the value of the strategies it generates. A SWOT item that produces 
valuable strategies is important. A SWOT item that generates no strategies is not important. 
Guidelines for of completing a SWOT Analysis 
 Be as specific as possible. Avoid any grey areas or generalities. 
 Describe internal factors in terms of the competition: as superior, better than, equal to or 
worse than your competition. 
 Be as realistic as possible regarding your strengths and weaknesses. 
 Always be Objective and 
 Keep the SWOT analysis as simple as possible, but include any and all relevant issues. 
 One of the points of doing a SWOT analysis is that it helps to generate an appropriate and 
open conversation among the group, about the reality of the situation. A realistic assessment 
increases the opportunity to create an effective plan. Try to use the SWOT to generate that 
conversation.

What Business are we in? Choosing a Strategic Position 
In every industry, there are a number of strategic positions that companies can occupy. For example 
Chevrolet has produced mid-priced cars for the North American market, while Ferrari produces very 
expensive cars for the world market. Both companies have been successful within the market they 
have chosen to occupy. 
The question is not what the strategy is, but whether the company 
has one strategic position that it can claim as its own. The 
strategic position is defined by the answers to the following 
questions: 
1.) Who is my target customer? 
2.) What products or services will we offer to those customers? 
3.) How will we provide the products or services? (delivery choices, 
pricing, terms) 
 Critical 
Thinking 
Defining a strategic position is done by identifying what products and services the business will offer, 
and which will not be offered. It is the act of choosing a distinctive strategy that will make the 
business successful. 
What business are we in? is really a key question. The cooperative’s steering committee can benefit 
from identifying and questioning assumptions and beliefs about what it intends to offer, and who the 
customers really are. Many businesses, in changing times, have proceeded in the belief that they 
were in a certain business, and found out they were really in another. 
The strategy must bridge the gap between what the customer wants and what the company does. 
Businesses must make this connection and the strategy helps to determine what the company 
spends its time doing. Each activity in a company must lead to or support the appropriate delivery of 
the product or service to the customer. Internally, each activity in a business affects all the other 
activities. 
Components of Feasibility Study 
The components of feasibility are outlined in this section to provide a cooperative with a guide when 
developing a study or have received a completed study from a consultant. In order for a business to 
succeed the feasibility study is the first step to creating a viable business entity. 
MARKET FEASIBILITY
Market feasibility identifies whether the product or service is viable within the competitive 
environment of the industry or marketplace. The study needs to identify and assess individual 
opportunities, and provide rationalization to proceed with that opportunity, or assess other 
alternatives. The study needs to include the total market potential and incorporate customer 
opinions regarding the particular service or product. 
The Industry Description
The industry description examines the industry or market segment and provides an assessment of 
its potential size and scope. The industry description should determine if the industry or market 
segment is stable, expanding or contracting, and what part of the industry life cycle it occupies. The 
description should also discuss the industry’s primary purpose, market served, scope in terms of 
annual sales, range of products and services, customer groups and major competitors. The history of 
the industry, how it changed and grown (or contracted) over time is also helpful. Changes in 
consumer demand, products and services, delivery and distribution models should be considered. 
Here are some of the concepts that an industry description will help with: 
1. Industry Competitiveness 
Traditionally, competition between two or more businesses drives profits lower. A highly 
concentrated industry or market segment is one in which market share is held by the few largest 
companies. When a very few companies hold, the vast majority of market share, there may be 
very little actual competition and the market may appear closer to a monopoly. An industry or 
market segment is considered to have low concentration when many companies own a small 
share of the market. An industry with very low concentration industry is considered to be 
fragmented, and as such can be highly competitive. 
The amount of competition within an industry or market segment is influenced by the following: 
 Large number of businesses – This increases competition as many companies compete for a 
limited number of consumers and inputs. 
 Low market growth – This result in firms having to struggle for a slowly growing market 
share. 
 High fixed costs – When an industry has high fixed costs (the cost of getting into and staying 
in the business), then players need to look for efficiencies in the size of their operation to 
achieve economies of scale and increase their potential profit. 
 Perishable goods – These are required to be sold quickly, and cannot be inventoried for long. 
This may lead to price cutting and other competitive dynamics, as businesses may need to 
unload large volumes of the same product around the same time. 
 Limited exchange costs – This has to do with the cost to the customer of exchanging or 
switching products or services. 
 Industry or market segment consolidation cycles – If competition increases to a point where 
there are so many suppliers that supply starts to exceed demand, some businesses will fail 
and the industry will consolidate to the point where the supply meets demand. 
2. Barriers to Entry 
In theory, given a supply of capital, businesses should be able to enter an industry or market 
segment without barriers. In reality, this is seldom the case. There are a number of factors that 
restrict the ability of new businesses to enter and start operating in a particular industry. 
The ease with which someone else can enter a market determines the likelihood that a business will 
face new competitors. The easier it is to enter the industry or market, the faster profits will be 
eroded by competition. On the other hand, the harder it is for new entrants to appear, the longer the 
competitive advantage lasts. Mature businesses have often developed greater operational 
efficiencies because they faced the pressure of competition and found ways to dig in and remain 
viable. 
The ease of entry into an industry or market segment depends upon two factors: how high are the 
barriers to entry in that industry, and how existing players react to new entrants. Existing 
competitors are most likely to react strongly against new entrants when there is a history of such 
behaviour, when the existing competitors have invested substantial resources, and when the 
industry is characterized by slow growth. In other words, the more that existing businesses have 
invested in the game, and the less there is to go around, the more likely they are to react strongly 
against newer players. 
In Michael E. Porter’s book Competitive Strategy Techniques for Analyzing Industries and 
Competitors, - Simon & Schuster - 1980 six major barriers to market entry are identified: 
Barriers to Market Entry 
1. Economies of scale. Economies of scale occur when the unit cost of a product declines as 
production volume increases. When existing competitors in an industry have achieved 
economies of scale, new entrants face a barrier because they must either compete on a 
large scale right away, or accept a cost disadvantage in order to compete on a smaller 
scale. 
2. Product differentiation. In many markets and industries, established competitors have 
gained customer loyalty and brand identification through their long-standing advertising 
and customer service efforts. This creates a barrier to market entry by forcing new 
entrants to spend time and money to differentiate their products in the marketplace and 
overcome these loyalties. 
3. Capital requirements. Another type of barrier to market entry occurs when new entrants 
are required to invest large financial resources in order to compete in an industry. For 
example, certain industries may require capital investments in inventories or production 
facilities. Capital requirements form a particularly strong barrier when the capital is 
required for risky investments like research and development. 
4. Switching costs. A switching cost refers to a one-time cost that is incurred by a buyer as 
a result of switching from one supplier's product to another's. Some examples of switching 
costs for a business customer include re-training employees, purchasing support 
equipment, enlisting technical assistance and redesigning products. 
1. Access to channels of distribution. In many industries, established competitors control the 
logical channels of distribution through long-standing relationships. In order to persuade 
distribution channels to accept a new product, new entrants often must provide incentives in 
the form of price discounts, promotions, and cooperative advertising. Such expenditures act 
as a barrier by reducing the profitability for new entrants. 
2. Government policy. In industries that are highly regulated, government policies can limit or 
prevent new competitors from entering industries, through licensing requirements, limits on 
access to raw materials, pollution standards, product testing regulations or other compliance 
issues. 
Established competitors also have a number of other cost advantages that act as barriers to market 
entry when they cannot be duplicated by new entrants, such as proprietary technology, favourable 
locations, government subsidies, good access to raw materials and experience and learning curves. 
3. Analysis of major competitors 
A competitor analysis is an essential component of cooperative strategy. The competitor analysis is 
an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of current and potential competitors. First, it 
identifies opportunities (any strategic weaknesses in rivals) and threats. Second, competitor profiling 
will allow the business to anticipate how competitors might respond to new entrants. Third, this 
knowledge will allow the business to consider strategies to respond to competitor behaviours. 
A competitor analysis should include: 
 An understanding of a key competitor’s vision, mission and objectives, allowing a new 
business to consider how its own guiding statements differ. 
 Identification of product or market segment strengths and weakness, to enable the new 
business to consider new and innovative products; 
 A determination of the size, configuration and operations of the competitor, which will allow 
new business owners to create realistic business projections based on appropriately priced 
products; 
 An analysis of how competitors use their distribution channels and direct sales activities; 
 A listing of the competitive payment terms and discounts, in order to make negotiating 
similar conditions simple; and 
 A sampling of the competitor’s marketing communications, which will allow a new business to 
create their own marketing communication plan to differentiate themselves. 
A common technique is to create detailed profiles on each of your major competitors. These profiles 
give an in-depth description of the competitor's background, finances, products, markets, facilities, 
personnel and strategies. 
MARKET POTENTIAL 
Market Potential is essential in determining the total sales for a given market. The analysis must 
provide a determination if the market is large enough to sustain the business entry in light of the 
competitive market conditions. The cooperative will require detail information providing specific 
information to be able to make an informed decision to proceed or abandon the business idea. 
What is marketing? 
Marketing is described by the American Marketing Association as “an organizational function and a 
set of processes for creating, communicating, and delivering value to customers and for managing 
customer relationships in ways that benefit the organization and its stakeholders. Marketing 
management is a process of setting marketing goals for an organization (considering internal 
resources and market opportunities), the planning and execution of activities to meet these goals, 
and measuring progress toward their achievement. 
Marketing is based on the importance of customers to a business and 
has two important principles: 
 All company policies and activities should be directed toward 
satisfying customer needs; and 
 Profitable sales volume is more important than maximum sales 
volume. 
To best use these principles, a small business should: 
 Determine the needs of their customers through market 
research; 
 Analyze their competitive advantages to develop a market 
strategy; 
 Select specific markets to serve by target marketing; and 
 Determine how to satisfy customer needs by identifying a market 
mix 
 Critical 
Thinking 
Marketing Plans 
The key component of a business plan is the marketing plan. A good marketing plan summarizes the 
who, what, where, when, and how much questions of company marketing and sales activities for the 
planning year: 
 Who are our target buyers? 
 What sources of uniqueness or positioning in the market do we have? 
 Where will we implement our marketing spending plans? 
 When will marketing spending plans occur? 
 How much sales, spending, and profits will we achieve? 
The financial projections contained in your business plan are based on the assumptions contained in 
your marketing plan. It is the marketing plan that details when expenditures will be made, what 
level of sales will be achieved, and how and when advertising and promotional expenditures will be 
made. Here are the major elements of a marketing plan: 
 Situation Analysis - describes the total marketing environment in which the company 
competes and the status of company products and distribution channels. 
 Opportunity and Issue Analysis - analyzes the major external opportunities and threats to 
the company and the internal strengths and weaknesses of the company, along with a 
discussion of key issues facing the company. 
 Goals and Objectives - outlines major company goals and the marketing and financial 
objectives. 
 Marketing strategy - provides the company's marketing strategy statement, summarizing 
the key target buyer description, competitive market segments the company will compete in, 
the unique positioning of the company and its products compared to the competition, the 
reasons why it is unique or compelling to buyers, price strategy versus the competition, 
marketing spending strategy with advertising and promotion, and possible Research and 
development and market research expenditure strategies. 
 Sales and Marketing Plan - outlines each specific marketing event or action plan to 
increase sales. For example, it may contain a summary of quarterly promotion and 
advertising plans, with spending, timing, and share or shipment goals for each program. 
Market Research 
Market Research is the function that links the businesses products or services with the consumer. 
Market research is the systematic gathering, recording, and analyzing of data about your market. 
This information is used to identify and define market opportunities and threats; generate, refine, 
and evaluate marketing actions; monitor marketing performance; and improve understanding of the 
market dynamics. Market research specifies the information required to address these issues, and 
communicates the findings and their implications. 
Market research asks the following questions: 
 Who are my customers and potential customers? 
 What kind of people are they? 
 Where do they live? 
 Can and will they buy? 
 Am I offering the kinds of goods or services they want at the best place, at the 
best time, and in the right amounts? 
 Are my prices consistent with what buyers view as the product's value? 
 Are my promotional programs working? 
 What do customers think of my business? 
 How does my business compare with those of my competitors? 
Market research focuses and organizes marketing information. It ensures that such information is 
timely and permits businesses to: 
 Reduce business risk 
 Spot current and upcoming problems in the current market 
 Identify sales opportunities 
 Develop plans of action 
Research Process 
Businesses may conduct market research at varying degrees of complexity or frequency. For 
example, a business might use a simple questionnaire to determine the demand in a small market, 
or may hire a professional market research firm to conduct research to assist them in developing a 
marketing strategy to launch a new product. Larger firms may have their own specialists on staff. 
Regardless of the simplicity or complexity of your market research project, the Small Business 
Association of America believes that the following seven market research steps must be completed 
to provide accurate information: 
Step One: Define Marketing Problems and Opportunities 
The market research process begins with identifying and defining the problems and opportunities 
that exist for your business, such as: 
 Launching a new product or service 
 Low awareness of your company and its products or services 
 Low uptake of your company's products or services (the market is familiar with your 
company, but still is not doing business with you) 
 A poor company image and reputation 
 Problems with distribution; your goods and services are not reaching the buying public in a 
timely manner 
Step Two: Set Objectives, Budget, and Timetables 
Objective: With a marketing problem or opportunity defined, the next step is to set objectives for 
your market research operations. 
Budget: How much money are you willing to invest in your market research? How much can you 
afford? Your market research budget is a portion of your overall marketing budget. If you are 
planning on launching a new product or business, market research should account for as 
much as 10 per cent of your expected gross sales. 
Timetables: Prepare a detailed, realistic timeframe to complete all steps of the market research 
process. If your business operates in cycles, establish target dates that will allow the best 
accessibility to your market. 
Step Three: Select Research Types, Methods, and Techniques 
There are two types of research: primary research (original information gathered for a specific 
purpose) and secondary research (information that already exists somewhere but needs to be 
interpreted for your use). 
Step Four: Design Research Instruments 
The most common research instrument is the questionnaire. Keep these tips in mind when designing 
your market research questionnaire. 
 Keep it simple. 
 Begin the survey with general questions and move towards more specific questions. 
 Design a questionnaire that is graphically pleasing and easy to read. 
 Remember to pre-test the questionnaire. 
 Mix the form of the questions. 
Step Five: Collect Data 
To help you obtain clear, unbiased and reliable results, collect the data under the direction of 
experienced researchers. 
Step Six: Organize and Analyze the Data 
Once your data has been collected, it needs to be cleaned. Cleaning research data involves editing, 
coding, and tabulating results. To make this step easier, start with a simply designed research 
instrument or questionnaire. 
Step Seven: Present and Use Market Research Findings
Once marketing information about your target market, competition and environment is collected and 
analyzed, present it in an organized manner for use by the business. 
Marketing Concepts
1. Commodities and Differentiated products
Commodities and differentiated products are the two ends of the product spectrum. A product is a 
commodity when all units of production are identical, regardless of who produces them. A 
differentiated product can be easily distinguished from those of its competitors. On the continuum 
between commodities and differentiated products, there are many degrees and combinations. 
Commodities 
A commodity means that each unit of a commodity is exactly like every other unit. For example, 
every bushel of number 1 Canadian Red Spring Wheat 11.5 per cent protein can be substituted for 
every other bushel of number 1 Canadian Red Spring Wheat 11.5 per cent protein. Because the 
identity of each producer’s wheat does not have to be kept separate, the wheat from many farmers 
can be mixed together. This also means that the price for wheat on any given day, at any given 
location, is the same for all farmers. 
Commodities tend to be raw materials like corn, wheat, copper, crude oil, etc. Only commodities can 
be traded on “futures” markets because every unit is the same. Commodities are often inputs to 
other (“finished”) products. These finished products may in turn be differentiated ones. 
2. Price Takers 
People that produce commodities are referred to as “price takers.” This means that an individual 
producer has no control over his/her price. On any day, the producer must take what the market 
offers. 
3. Differentiated Products 
A company’s product is a differentiated product if it is unique and cannot be substituted for a 
competitor’s product. If the product is different, the producer can make the case that it is better. If 
it is a better product, in the eyes of customers, and they are willing to pay more, then the company 
can charge a higher price for it. The customers can see a difference in value between it and a 
possible substitute. 
4. Price Maker 
The producer of a differentiated product is said to be a price maker rather than a price taker. A price 
maker has some influence over price, but not as much as most people believe. Essentially, a 
producer of a differentiated product creates a separate market for that product, to the extent that 
they are able to do so through marketing activities and demand. 
5. Perceptions Are Everything 
There is the false perception in agriculture that the emergence of niche markets provides for 
unlimited product differentiation. For example, the organic milk market niche offers you the 
opportunity to differentiate your milk from commodity milk. While it does allow you to differentiate 
your milk from commodity milk, your organic milk is not necessarily a differentiated product. 
Producing organic milk puts you in a different (albeit smaller) commodity market. Your product is no 
different than any other organic producer’s milk. 
6. The Value Added Differentiated Fallacy 
Differentiation only takes place when the product you produce is seen as different. So you need to 
convince organic milk purchasers that your organic milk is better than that of your competitors. One 
way of doing this is to create a brand for your product (e.g. Johnson’s Better Organic Milk), and 
promote your brand to organic milk purchasers. 
7. Target Marketing 
Target Marketing is the practice of directing the marketing effort at a specific market segment. A 
target market, or segment, on which a business may focus, is a group of potential buyers that the 
business believes will want to or do want to buy that product. 
Defining a target market is the process of pulling apart the potential 
market as a whole and defining and isolating the manageable, 
disparate units that will make up the segment. 
The process includes: 
1.) Determining the unique characteristics of segments in the 
target market, then finding these segments in the larger 
market based on those characteristics. 
2.) Checking to see whether any of the market segments are 
large enough, and have the buying power, to support the 
organization's product. If not, the organization must return 
to step one (or review its product to see if it is viable). 
3.) Once it is clear how to find the desired target market, the 
business can develop its marketing strategy to reach it. 
 Critical 
Thinking 
8. What is Branding? 
Branding is one of the most important factors influencing an item's success or failure in today's 
marketplace. A brand is a combination of name, words, symbols, design, reputation and association. 
It identifies a product and/or its company and differentiates it from competition. 
9. Niche Marketing
Niche marketing is marketing a product or service in a small portion of a market that is not being 
readily served by the mainstream product or service providers. These “niches” can be geographic 
areas, a specialty industry, a specific demographic or ethnic group, one gender, a specific interest 
group, or other special group of people. 
10. Ethnic Marketing 
What is ethnicity? It is a multidimensional expression of identity that includes race, origin or 
ancestry, language and religion. It is influenced by immigration, blending and intermarriage, which 
very often influence the strength of ethnic identification. It is often associated with cultural practices, 
customs and beliefs and sometimes dress and eating habits. Ethnicity depends partly on selfidentification. Everyone chooses whether they want to identify with a particular ethnic group or not. 
Identifying with more than one group is more and more common, as cultural mixing is increasingly 
on the rise. 
Module 3.2 - Developing Sales Forecast 
Sales forecasting is the process of organizing and analyzing information in a way that makes it 
possible for the business to estimate future sales. 
The forecast estimates the number of units of product or service a business will sell within a 
specified time period and at a given price. Sales forecasting is one of the most difficult portions of 
the feasibility study, but one of the most important. Sales forecasts for a start-up cooperative are 
inherently more difficult than forecasting for more mature cooperatives. Nevertheless, an educated 
estimate, based on market data collected in a systematic fashion, is extremely important to 
investors and financial institutions considering supplying capital to the cooperative. 
The true value in making a forecast is that it forces us to look at the future 
objectively. It will also help establish policies so that the business can easily monitor prices and 
operating costs to maximize profits, and make the business aware of problems before they 
become major. 
Companies that use accurate sales forecasting processes realize important benefits such as: 
1. Detailed consumer pattern information; 
2. Identification of sales patterns or trends (seasonality); 
3. Knowledge of the production process 
4. Planned production and capacity; and 
5. Inventory control, manageable overhead costs. 
The combination of these benefits may result in: 
 Increased revenue; 
 Increased customer retention; 
 Decreased costs; 
 Increased efficiency; and 
 Increased profitability. 
For sales forecasting to be valuable to your business, it must not be treated as an isolated exercise. 
Rather, it must be integrated into all facets of your organization. 
ESTIMATING MARKET POTENTIAL 
An estimate of market potential reveals whether a market is sufficient to support the size and scope 
of the business being contemplated. The market potential provides information for sales forecasting, 
which in turns helps determine the overall feasibility of the business idea. The market potential 
estimate generally provides the upper end of the potential market, expressed in either units or sales. 
It is reasonable to assume that with appropriate marketing techniques and competitive pricing, the 
business can occupy a portion of the overall potential market. 
Steps in Estimating Market Potential: 
1.) Define your target market and market segments; 
2.) Define the geographic boundaries of the market; 
3.) Assume an average selling price (from the competitive analysis) ; and 
4.) Determine the average annual consumption. 
Consumption rates or usage rates can be estimated by researching through trade association 
materials, reference guides found in many libraries (such as the Business Directory, Trade and 
Professional Association of Canada), and the National Reference Book. Once this information has 
been estimated, the following formula can derive an estimated market potential. 
Estimated Market Potential: MP = N x P x Q, where: 
MP = Market Potential 
N = Number of Possible Buyers 
P = Average Selling Price 
Q = Average Annual Consumption Rate 
 
Remember, the better the estimates that go into the formula, the better the estimate of the 
potential market. 
Trade Area Analysis is a means of evaluating the potential retail sales for a specific operation 
using a standard formula: 
Estimated Sales for a Trade Area: 
ES = P x EXP x (PS/TMS) x MS, where 
ES = Estimated Sales 
P = Market Area Population 
EXP= Average Expenditures for Retail Outlet Category 
PS = Proposed Store Space 
TMS= Total Market Selling Space 
MS = Estimated Market Share 
Example A – Feasibility Analysis for a Locally Owned Cooperative Hardware Store in 
Anytown, Manitoba. 
Step 1: Calculate Market Potential (example only) 
1. Market Area Population (P). The market area is the population of Anytown plus the 
surrounding area. This region includes the towns within a 50 km radius of Anytown. The 
population of this market area is approximately 16,500. (Source – Anytown Community 
Profile, 2006 edition - Statistics Canada) 
2. Sales for the Market Area (EXP). The per capita annual sales for hardware stores at a retail 
outlet in the market area will be determined by accessing the following sources: 
1.) the wholesale company that will provide statistics on average hardware 
expenditures based on other locally owned cooperative hardware stores in similarly 
sized communities. 
2.) if this information is not available, find the per capita sales by taking Canadian or 
provincial hardware sales, divided by the respective population. This information is 
available from Statistics Canada. 
Hardware Sales (2006) = Per Capita Sales 
 Population of Canada (2006) 
$8,219,353,200 = $260 
 31,612,897 
Once the per capita sales have been determined, this number can be applied to the market 
area population. 
Anytown = Population x Per Capita Sales 
 = 9,200 x $260 
 = $2,292,000 
Surrounding Area = Population x Per Capita Sales 
 = 6,700 x $260 
 = $1,742,000 
Thirty-eight per cent of the surrounding area purchased hardware items in Anytown, multiply 
this figure by 0.38: 
Surrounding Area = $1,742,000 x 0.38 
 = $661,960 
Total Market Potential = $2,292,000 + $661,960 
 = $2,953,960 
3. Adjustments. Typical adjustments might include updating secondary information regarding 
population and purchases by applying past trends. 
Step 2: Calculate Market Share (MS) 
1.) Estimate the selling space in the market. There is one other hardware store in Anytown with 
a size of 3,000 square metres. 
2.) Size of proposed store. The size of the proposed hardware store is 4,500 square metres. 
3.) Calculation of market share. Percentage share of the market: 
Proposed Store Selling Space = 4,500 m = 60% 
 Total Selling Space 3,000 m + 4,500 m 
4.) Adjustments. The percentage of the market share would probably have to be decreased, 
because the proposed hardware retailer is new and would not have built up the customers or the 
reputation of an existing store. Based on the above factors, market share has been adjusted by 
10 per cent to 50 per cent. 
5.) Multiple Market Share x Market Potential = Estimated Market Share 
$2,953,960 x 50% = $1,476,690

CREATING A PRICE STRATEGY 
The price of the product may need to support a high-cost manufacturing process, or exclusive 
distribution system, or extensive advertising. On the other hand, pricing adjustments can 
compensate for a lower quality product, less effective promotions, or erratic merchandising efforts 
by distributors. 
Creating an effective pricing strategy should accomplish four goals: 
1.) Provide a rate of return to the business that is acceptable to the cooperative. (e.g. 
generate profit); 
2.) Take into consideration consumers’ demand at the price that is set; 
3.) Take into consideration the image or branding of the product or service; and 
4.) Take into consideration quality of the product, the type of distribution channels, and the 
quality of promotion. 
SETTING THE PRICE 
Many start-up businesses that are looking at setting the price for a product or service ask the 
question, “What price should I charge?” However, in creating a pricing strategy, a more customerfocused question to ask is, “What is the value to the customer of the product or service and other 
intangibles provided by the business?” 
In order for a business to survive in the long term, the pricing must cover the total cost of operating 
the business, plus a rate of return to the cooperative. 
Total revenue is influenced by two considerations: sales volume and price. 
Price influences sales volume. People make purchase decisions partly on price. Thus even a small 
change in the price of the product or service can affect sales, and change the amount of total 
revenue. 
Total cost has three components: 
1.) The cost of goods sold: includes the direct expenses attributable to the production of the 
goods sold by the business. This amount includes the cost of materials used in creating 
the goods or services, along with the direct labour costs used to produce them. 
2.) The selling costs: includes indirect expenses such as distribution costs and sales force 
costs. 
3.) Overhead costs: includes storage expenses, premises, utilities, salaries, taxes, etc. 
There are two main types of expenses: fixed expenses and variable expenses. Each type of expense 
acts differently when the product or service is sold. Understanding the behaviour of the different 
kinds of expenses can help the business minimize pricing mistakes. 
Fixed Expenses are those expenses that do not change over time or as production changes. 
Assuming the same number of employees and the same premises, salaries, rent, taxes, insurance, 
heating and lighting are relatively fixed. Fixed expenses can also be called “indirect” expenses, as 
they are not directly associated with the final product. Fixed costs are those that have to be paid 
even if the company is not producing any goods. 
Variable Expenses are those expenses that change as production changes. Examples can include raw 
materials or electricity. . Variable expenses can also be called “direct” expenses, as they are directly 
associated with production. 
BREAKEVEN ANALYSIS 
Breakeven Analysis compares alternative income and expense estimates to determine the suitability 
of each price. It can also be used to analyze the potential profitability of a capital investment for a 
sales-based business. 
The breakeven point for a product is the point where total revenue received equals the total costs 
associated with the sale of the product. 
To provide a complete analysis, the breakeven analysis should include two sections: first one to 
analyze the income/expense relationship, and the second to incorporate actual forecasts into the 
analysis. As a result, if the product can be sold in a larger quantity than that which occurs at the 
breakeven point, then the business should make a profit otherwise below this point, it will be a loss. 
Breakeven quantity is calculated by: 
Breakeven Calculation 
Breakeven Point (in units) = Total Fixed Costs
 Per Unit Contribution to Fixed Costs 
 = Total Fixed Costs
 Price Per Unit – Variable Costs Per Unit 
And 
Breakeven Point (in dollars) = Total Fixed Costs
 Variable Costs per Unit 
 Selling Price Per Unit 1
A company produces widgets from a rented retail store. The annual fixed costs are $80,000. The 
company sells each the widget for $0.75 and the variable cost of each widget is $0.50. The 
breakeven point in sales and dollars is: 
BP Units TFC = $80,000 = 80,000 = 320,000 
 P-VC 0.75 – 0.50 = 0.25 
BP $ TFC = $80,000 = 80,000 = $80,000
 1 – VC = 1 – .50 = 1 –.67 = .33 
 P .75 
= $242,424 of revenue for the company to breakeven 
PRICING OBJECTIVES 
In order to establish the price of a product or service the business must establish its pricing 
objectives. Pricing objectives create clear concise direction of the price of the service or product. The 
following steps should be considered within the pricing objectives: 
1.) What is the target revenue of the company? 
2.) What are the objectives of the company branding? 
3.) Will consumers respond to the company’s price objectives? 
Some pricing objectives could be: 
 Increase market share 
 Increase sales volume (quantity) 
 Increase dollar sales 
 Increase store traffic 
 Maximize long-run profit 
 Maximize short-run profit 
 Match competitors’ prices 
 Obtain a target rate of return on 
investment (ROI) 
 Obtain a target rate of return on sales 
 Company growth 
 Encourage marginal firms to leave the 
industry 
 Survival 
 Obtain or maintain loyalty 
 Increase distributors’ marketing of 
product or service 
 Enhance the image of the firm, brand, 
or product 
 Create interest in a product/service 
 Discourage competitors from cutting 
prices 
 Maintain price leadership 
 Discourage new business entering the 
industry 
 Social, ethical, or ideological 
objectives 
 Enhance viability of the product or 
service 
From a revenue standpoint, the price of the product or service should 
be the maximum consumers are willing to pay. 
In reality, a good pricing strategy would be a balance between the 
price floor (the price below which the organization ends up in losses) 
and the price ceiling (the price beyond which the organization 
experiences a no-demand situation). 
 Critical 
Thinking 
A number of common pricing strategies are listed below. 
 Penetration Pricing 
 Skimming Pricing 
 Follow-the-Leader Pricing 
 Prestige Pricing 
 Variable Pricing 
 Flexible Pricing 
 Price Lining 
Module 3.3 Technical Feasibility 
The technical feasibility study involves questions such as whether the technology needed for the 
proposed business exists yet, how difficult it will be to build, and what is the experience level of the 
firm supplying the technology. The reason for asking these questions is to determine the level of 
technology cost and risk that a business may be looking at. 
The assessment is based on defined technology requirements in terms of input, processes, output, 
programs and procedures. The assessment can be defined in terms of the amount of productivity, 
frequency that the machinery or equipment must be updated, etc. This assessment will either qualify 
the technology or identify possible inadequacies that will have to be addressed. 
The technical feasibility study should also determine the availability of a qualified labour force. 
For cooperatives requiring production facilities, it is this stage of business development that will 
generally absorb the majority of the investment capital. Therefore, from a capital investment 
perspective, the technical feasibility study must be conducted with all the diligence and appropriate 
skills necessary to address the requisite issues. 
Where production facilities are involved, the technical feasibility reports address the suitability of the 
selected site for the intended use, including an environmental impact analysis. The report must be 
based upon verifiable data and contain sufficient information and analysis to determine the technical 
feasibility of being able to produce product at the rate assumed by the financial projections. 
The report must also identify any constraints or limitations in these financial projections and any 
other facility or design-related factors which might affect the success of the enterprise. The report 
needs to identify and estimate operating and development costs, specify the level of accuracy of 
these estimates and the assumptions on which they are based. For the purpose of the technical 
feasibility reports, the project engineer or architect must be an independent third party. 
Site Location 
The analysis of a possible new location should quantify any geographical competitive advantage. 
While project drivers, measures of success and project parameters will vary by company, industry 
and facility, the underlying approach to choosing a location is consistent. Greg Brown and Alison 
McMahon, of Deloitte & Touche Fantus, advise “A successful strategy defines critical issues and 
objectives prior to discussing specific locations. Possible objectives for a new facility include 
achieving operating efficiencies, expanding or reducing capacity, reducing costs or improving labour 
draw.” 
The cooperative should define the geographic search area and the size and scope of a project. In 
addition, prior to the site selection process the following questions should be asked: 
What is the fundamental purpose of establishing the new facility? 
What objectives should be considered and why? 
How do these objectives affect organizational initiatives? 
What industry trends and internal imperatives need to be considered in the decision? 
A useful tool in deciding on a suitable site is to quantify individual sites based on a scoring 
system. You may use words like “adequate” and “unsatisfactory” to evaluate the site. You may 
also use a numbering system (i.e., 1 for least satisfactory and 5 for most satisfactory) and total 
the score for the site. Evaluate each site according to this scoring system by totaling the scores 
for each site and comparing them. This will provide the business with a simple method of 
comparing sites. 
Production Assessment 
The objective of the technical feasibility assessment is to determine whether the technology being 
considered for the proposed project is suitable for the desired quantity and quality of product that 
the cooperative wants to produce. 
The feasibility assessment of the operations and production technologies is conducted by laying out 
the physical production process from the point of receiving the input to packaging, transfer to 
storage, warehousing and/or delivery. 
This segment of the research must also consider the physical layout of equipment and how 
it impacts operational efficiency. Additionally, scalability of the equipment and associated 
technologies must also be assessed, to ensure that is not locked into a scale, but instead can take 
advantage of future success and expand.
The report should includes advantages and disadvantages in the technologies from different 
perspectives: number of employees and skill level required to effectively operate equipment, utility 
services requirements, maintenance routines, shut down protocols, etc. In addition, the study should 
provide a clear foundation for the economic assessment of alternative technical solutions and their 
operational requirements for the project. 
The technical efficiencies of the alternative technologies should be weighed against their economic 
efficiencies, to determine their overall effectiveness in the project’s feasibility. 
The best sources of the economic data for the assessment of technologies and operations are 
suppliers. Such primary data can be collected by providing a detailed description of the product 
being considered to potential technical suppliers in a Request for Quote (RFQ) offer. The principal 
advantage of using an RFQ is to improve your knowledge about alternative solutions, of which you 
may be unaware, should you only work with one supplier. 
Module 3.4 Financial Feasibility 
The purpose of a financial feasibility study is to determine and evaluate the business concept’s ability 
to generate sufficient income to pay debt and reinvest in the business. The financial plan should 
identify any performance bonds included in the project construction, technology guarantees, the 
financing plan, the level and type of insurance coverage that will be needed, and any lines of credit 
and standby financing requirements. 
Total Capital Requirements 
Debt Financing is the process of raising money for working capital or capital expenditures by selling 
bonds, bills or notes to individual and/or institutional investors. In return for lending the money, the 
individuals or institutions become creditors and receive a promise that the principal and interest on 
the debt will be repaid. 
Equity Financing is the process of raising money for company activities by selling common or 
preferred stock to individual or institutional investors. In return for the money paid, shareholders 
receive ownership interests in the corporation. 
Equity Financing in a Cooperative Environment — Equity capital is created by selling membership 
and special investment shares in the cooperative. The cooperative may also plan to issue investment 
shares to non-members. 
Types of Credit 
There are two types of credit: consumer credit (granted by retailers to consumers who purchase 
consumer goods for consumption) and trade credit (when one firm provides goods or services to a 
customer with an agreement to bill them later, or receive a shipment or service from a supplier 
under an agreement to pay them later). 
Consumer Credit — can be charge accounts, installment accounts, and revolving charge accounts. 
Charge Accounts — allow consumers to obtain a product immediately. Payment is due at time of 
billing. 
Installment Accounts — the practice of lending one lump sum that is paid back gradually through 
periodic payments by the borrower. 
Revolving Accounts — Revolving credit is a line of credit that is replenished to its maximum 
amount when you pay it off. 
Credit Cards — entitle the holder to buy goods and services based on the holder's promise to pay 
for these goods and services at a later date. 
Trade Credit — exists when one firm provides goods or services to a customer with an agreement 
to bill them later, or receive a shipment or service from a supplier under an agreement to pay them 
later. 
Trade credit can be viewed as an essential element of capitalization in an operating business 
because it can reduce the required capital investment to operate the business if it is managed
properly. The business sell the goods subject to specific repayment period, such as “2/10, net 30”. 
This means that a two per cent discount is given by the seller if the buyer pays within 10 days of the 
invoice date. Failure to take this discount makes the full payment of the invoice amount due in 30 
days. 
Financial Institution Financing 
Seed and Start-up Capital — Seed and start-up capital refers to the financing sources of available 
during the development and start-up stage of a business’s life cycle. Seed and start-up capital in 
small businesses could include the business owner’s physical and financial assets, family and friends, 
and business “angels” or “angel investors”. Larger business may utilize venture capitalists, who 
specialize in investing in start-up companies. In the first round of financing, the definition widens to 
encompass venture capitalists, commercial financial institutions and government assistance. 
During the survival stage, financing often comes from suppliers, customers, venture capitalists and 
operations. 
Business Angels are individuals or companies willing to invest in start-up companies for a share in 
any financial rewards. Angels are difficult to find; generally angel investors are networked with 
accountants and lawyers, and usually need an introduction or recommendation from one of these 
before they become interested in a business opportunity. 
Venture Capitalists are a type of private equity capital typically provided to early-stage, highpotential, growth companies in the interest of generating a return on investment. Venture capital 
investments are generally made as cash, in exchange for shares in the invested company. 
Commercial Financial Institutions typically provide loans to start-up companies, usually only 
after two to three years of operating history. Commercial financial institutions usually provide only 
capital in the survival stage in the form of operating loans. Typically, commercial financial 
institutions will only provide long-term financing to established businesses.

Investment Financing is the traditional purview of investment banks, which help businesses to raise 
funds in the capital markets and advise on mergers and acquisitions. 
Aging of Accounts Receivable is the process of categorizing each account receivable by the 
number of days it has been outstanding. Scheduled review of the aged accounts receivable listing 
allows a business to identify collection trends create a plan of action to eliminate the problem 
accounts. 
Financial Institution Financing is the most common source of funds for a business. There are 
three basic types of financing provided by financial institutions: 
1.) Operating Loans or Lines of Credit — a short-term loan to cover the business’s peak 
working capital requirements. Operating loans provide a predetermined amount of credit for 
day-to-day expenses such as accounts receivables, inventory, etc. An operating loan is 
intended to supplement the business’s own working capital. An operating loan can also 
provide much-needed capital in the event of unexpected cash flow interruptions. 
2.) Term Loans — typically, term loans are for fixed assets such as machinery, vehicles and 
commercial buildings. They usually have to be repaid in two to ten years, which is related to 
the lifespan of the asset being financed. Term loans can have fixed interest rates or variable 
interest rates. 
Note: Both operating loans and term loans are “demand” loans, so the financial institution 
can demand repayment of the loan at any time. 
3.) Mortgages are loans made using real estate as collateral to secure repayment. A commercial 
mortgage is similar to a residential mortgage, except the collateral is a commercial building 
or other business real estate, not residential property. 
The Canada Small Business Financing Program seeks to increase the availability of loans for 
establishing, expanding, modernizing and improving small businesses. It does this by encouraging 
financial institutions to make their financing available to small businesses. Under the program, a 
business must apply for a loan at a financial institution (bank, credit union or caisse populaire) of its 
choice. Under the Canada Small Business Financing Act, the program can assist businesses in 
obtaining term loans of up to $250,000 to help finance fixed asset needs. 
Business Development Bank of Canada — is a crown corporation financial institution wholly owned 
by the Government of Canada. BDC delivers financial and consulting services to Canadian small 
business, with a particular focus on technology and exporting. BDC offers a higher percentage of 
long-term financing on your fixed and intangible assets, and financing flexibility that allows you to 
manage day-to-day operations. 
Evaluating Financing Options 
When evaluating financing options it is wise to shop around and compare options and terms. This 
includes: 
 Interest rates; 
 Transaction fees of loan and deposits; 
 Prepayment terms; 
 Flexible repayment terms; 
 Security and personal guarantees; 
 Quality of all overall service provided by the institution; 
 Expected processing time; and 
 Does the financial institution have knowledge of the industry being financed? 
Loan Security Agreements 
Loan security agreements document giving a lender a security interest in assets or property pledged 
as collateral. The security agreement may cover liens in intangible property such as accounts 
receivable, or a lien, in which the lender holds the collateral (for example: stock certificates) until 
the loan is fully paid. In some loans, the security agreement is also the financing statement filed 
with a public records office, if it has the signatures of both borrower and lender. 
Types of Loan Security Agreements 
Promissory Note 
A promissory note is a written promise to pay a specified sum of money to the lender either on 
demand or on a specified date. 
Real Property Mortgage 
The real property mortgage is a loan (mortgage) whose proceeds are applied to the purchase or refinance of land and buildings. A charge against the title is registered with the Province. 
Chattel Mortgage 
The chattel mortgage is a mortgage on specific assets other than land and buildings. A lien charge 
against the title is registered with the Province. 
Pledge 
The pledge is an agreement similar to the chattel mortgage, except in that possession is transferred 
to the lender but title remains with the borrower, e.g., your stocks and bonds held by the bank. 
Floating Charge 
The floating charge is an agreement which designates that all the remaining assets in debenture the 
business, not already mortgaged as security for other debts, will be taken as the security for the 
new debt. The title remains with the business but the debenture is registered with the Province. 
Personal Guarantee 
This agreement says the business owners will agree that if the limited company is unable to repay 
the loan, the business owners will do so personally. If this is in addition to other securities, the 
business owners would be wise to try to negotiate a limited guarantee to cover the shortfall in the 
security for the loan. 
Postponement of a Claim 
The Postponement of a Claim allows the lender to ask for assurance that the company will not repay 
the shareholders until the secured lenders have been repaid in full. 
Determine the Start-up Financial Requirements 
Accurately estimating how much capital the business will need is crucial to success. To determine 
the business start-up costs, you must identify all the expenses that your business will incur during 
its start-up phase. 
One-time Expenses 
One-time expenses are the expenses that must be made before the start of the business. The 
expenses include both capital expenditures and soft expenses. Capital expenditures can include the 
purchase of signage, fixtures and equipment, beginning inventory or office supplies. Soft expenses 
are such items as prepaid utility bills or deposits, advertising and promotion that must be paid prior 
to the opening of the business, etc. 
A realistic start-up budget should only include those things that are necessary to start the business. 
These essential expenses can then be divided into two separate categories: fixed and variable. Fixed 
expenses include rent, utilities, administrative costs, and insurance costs. Variable expenses include 
inventory, shipping and packaging costs, sales commissions, and other costs associated with the 
direct sale of a product or service. 
Operating Expenses 
Operating expenses are salaries and wages, rent and normal operating expenses that must be paid 
until the business turns a profit. Many business take months or even years before showing a 
sustainable profit margin. The cash flow projections will provide a guide as to when the business will 
generate sufficient operating income to routinely pay operating expenses but, as a rule, a small 
business should have sufficient funds to cover a minimum of three months operating expenses and a 
larger business should have funds available to cover operating expenses for one year.

Sensitivity Analysis 
A sensitivity analysis enables the business owner to see a true picture of the potential for gain and 
loss. In essence, the sensitivity analysis compares potential income statements for best- and worstcase scenarios. 
A sensitivity analysis can help businesses in making decisions. The business may want to consider, 
for example, the effect of increased raw material, labour or overhead costs; of reducing prices, with 
constant volumes, to counteract competitors; or reducing volumes, with constant prices, due to 
over-optimistic forecasts. Including a sensitivity analysis in the business feasibility plan will 
demonstrate that the business has thought about some of the potential risks and how they may be 
avoided. 
A sensitivity analysis considers ‘what if?’ scenarios. What 
happens to a business’s cash position, for example, if sales fall 
by 10 per cent? What happens if the business’s main supplier 
increases raw material prices by 12 per cent? 
A sensitivity analysis is particularly used by financial 
institutions when considering propositions for a loan. If the 
business is particularly susceptible to small changes, then the 
business probably does not have business model that yields a 
sufficiently large profit margin. Thus it is less likely to receive 
requested credit.

Module 3.5 Developing Projected Financial Statements 
In Ralph Estes's Dictionary of Accounting (MIT, Cambridge, 1981, p. 105), a projected financial 
statement is defined as "a financial statement prepared on the basis of some assumed events and 
transactions that have not yet occurred." A projected financial statement attempts to predict the 
future. Projected statements can identify opportunities and/or obstacles which the business will need 
to take into consideration. The statements can also examine alternatives and possibilities prior to 
expending capital. 
PROJECTED BALANCE SHEET 
The balance sheet is a snapshot taken at a moment in time. The information presented is 
cumulative, in that it summarizes, for that moment in time, the net effect of all financial activity 
since the business began. Usually a balance sheet is produced at the end of a reporting period. In 
the balance sheet, the business can easily see the relationship between debt (liabilities) and equity. 
The balance sheet presents a detailed listing of what a business owns, what it owes and its net 
worth, at a specific point in time. It is a stock measure of the business's financial condition. The 
basic equation of the balance sheet is: 
 Assets = Liabilities + Equity

Current Asset: is an asset on the balance sheet which is expected to be sold or otherwise used up 
in the near future, usually within one year, or one business cycle. Current assets include cash, cash 
equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, the portion of prepaid accounts which will be used 
within a year, and short-term investments. 
Fixed asset: is comprised of property, plant and equipment, or property which cannot easily be 
converted into cash. In most cases, only tangible assets are referred to as fixed. These are items of 
value which the cooperative has bought and will use for an extended period of time. 
Current Liabilities: are considered liabilities of the business that are to be settled in cash within
the fiscal year or the operating cycle, whichever period is longer. For example accounts payable for 
goods, services or supplies that were purchased for use in the operation of the business, and are 
payable within a normal period of time, would be current liabilities 
Long Term Liabilities: are a type of debt. Bonds, mortgages and loans that are payable over a 
term exceeding one year would be long term liabilities. 
Member Equity: is the capital invested in the organization by cooperative members 
Retained earnings: is the portion of net income which is retained by the corporation rather than 
distributed to its owners as dividends. 
PROJECTED PROFORMA INCOME STATEMENT 
Pro Forma income statements are used to generate projected financial statements, which provide an 
estimate of the income, expenses, assets and liabilities of operating a business throughout the year. 
Financial institutions generally demand the pro forma statements when considering a loan request. 
The first step in creating projected financial statements is the pro forma income statement. The 
statement shows all sales revenues, cost of goods sold, losses, operating expenses, taxes and 
depreciation on property, plant and equipment. The formula to calculate income and expenses is 
simple: 
 Revenue – Expenses = Net Profit before Taxes 
The purpose of the income statement is to show the management team and the members of the 
cooperative whether the business is expected to make or lose money during the period in question. 
The information needed to complete a pro forma income statement includes the following: 
1.) The projected sales volume for the year 
2.) The expected expense of producing or purchasing the product or service (cost of 
goods sold) 
3.) The amount of fixed operating expenses, such as insurance, utilities, rent, interest 
costs, and other such items, for the year. 
4.) The variable operating expenses such as wages and benefits, advertising and 
transportation. 
5.) The anticipated net operating profit or loss. 
Net sales are the amount of gross sales reduced by customer discounts, returns, freight out and 
allowances. 
Cost of Goods Sold is defined as the direct expenses incurred in the production of the goods or 
services sold by the business. This is the materials cost incurred in creating the goods, together with 
the direct labour costs used to produce them. 
Total Cost has three components: 
1.) The Cost of Goods Sold: This includes the direct expenses attributable to the 
production of the goods sold by the business. It includes the materials cost used in 
creating the goods, along with the direct labour costs used to produce them. 
2.) The selling costs: this includes indirect expenses such as distribution costs and sales 
force costs. 
3.) Overhead costs: this includes storage expenses, utilities, salaries, taxes, and other 
items. 
Net sales less net operating profit or loss will create the estimated gross margin or gross profit. 
Gross profit is one of the most important measures of a business. The larger the gross profit 
margin, the greater the cushion for covering all other business expenses, while being able to provide 
a sufficient return to the cooperative.

It is important to note that different types of companies have much different inventory 
requirements, costs of goods sold and/or operating expenses. Service industries, for example, 
typically do not hold an inventory of goods for sale. Manufacturing companies, on the other hand, 
may hold many different types and quantities of inventory.. The appropriate level of inventory for 
each type of business should be determined and reflected in the projected net sales. 
The operating expenses should be broken down to show each major type of expense, as a 
percentage of overall operating expenses. This provides an estimate of where the business will be 
spending the majority of the operating budget. The projection not only serves as a planning tool, 
outlining the requirements of the business, but it can also be used as a benchmark to and monitor 
the actual performance of the business in the early stages. 
FORECASTING CASH FLOW 
The next step in the projected financial statement preparation is to prepare a projected cash flow. 
The projected cash flow financial statement assesses the financial feasibility of the business: how 
well it will be able to control its day to day financial affairs. 
The cash flow statement traces the flow of funds (or working capital) into and out of your business 
for the year. A cash flow statement is used to assess the timing, amount and predictability of future 
cash flows and is used as the basis for budgeting. You can use a cash flow statement to answer the 
questions, "Where did the money come from?" and "Where did it go”? 
The cash flow statement measures only the cash inflow and outflow of the business. Non-cash 
accounting entries that show up on the income statement such as depreciation, amortization and the 
acquisition or disposal of assets are not included in the cash flow. 
The cash flow is used by the financial institution to evaluate the firm's ability to generate cash to 
repay its debt, buy equipment or expand the business. 
There are three sections to the cash flow statement: 
1. Operating Activities 
2. Investment Activities 
3. Financing Activities 
Net cash flow starts with the net income amount, makes adjustments for all non-cash items, then 
adjusts for all cash-based transactions. Only actual cash items remain, because the point is to 
forecast the effect on the company’s actual cash position at various points in time. 
An increase in an asset account is subtracted from net income, and an increase in a liability account 
is added back to net income. This method converts accrual-basis net income (or loss) into cash flow 
by using a series of additions and deductions. 
Operating activities (all transactions and events that normally enter into the determination of 
operating income) include cash receipts from selling goods or providing services, as well as income 
from items such as interest and dividends. Operating activities also include cash payments such as 
inventory, payroll, taxes, interest, utilities, and rent. The net amount of cash provided (or used) by 
operating activities is the key figure on a statement of cash flows. 
The following formula determines the cash flow from operations: 
(+) Cash received from customers 
(+) Other operating Receipts 
 = Total Cash Receipts from Operations (A)
 (-) Cash Paid to Suppliers 
 (-) Cash Paid to Employees 
 (-) Interest Paid 
 (-) Taxes Paid 
 (-) Other Cash Payments 
 (=) Total Cash Payments from Operations (B) 
Total Net Cash Provided by Operations = (A) + (B) 
The following formula determines the cash flow from investments: 
(+) Cash Proceeds from sale of assets 
 (+) Sale of investments in equity securities of other entities or debt securities (other than 
 cash equivalents) 
 (+) Collection of principal on loans made to other entities 
 (-) Cash Disbursements for the purchase of land/building or equipment 
 (-) Loans to other entities 
 (-) Purchase of equity securities of other entities or debt securities (other than 
cash equivalents) 
(=) Total Net Cash Investment 
The following formula determines the cash flow from financing: 
 (+) Cash received from financial institutions 
 (+) Proceeds of issuing stock 
 (+) Capital contributions by owners 
(=) Total cash received from financing (A) 
 (-) Repayment of principal on loans 
 (-) Dividends paid to shareholders

Module 3.6 - Establishing Criteria to Proceed or Abandon a Business Idea 
At each stage by having pre-established “minimum acceptable" criteria makes the decision-making 
activity easier. Either the business idea or project meets the minimum criteria or it does not. 
If it does not, then you can make a decision to abandon the idea in its current form. If the idea or 
project meets or exceeds the criteria, you can proceed to analyze the next stage. This is where the 
ability to remain focused and objective is very important. If a “maybe” enters the decision, then it is 
likely that goal or the information is not defined well enough. It may be necessary at this point to redefine the goals and start again, seek more information on a specific point, or to do the activity 
more thoroughly. 
THE IDEA 
Every idea has some merit and some drawbacks. Out of 100 ideas or more, there may be one or two 
real opportunities. Superior business ideas that have potential to become opportunities have 5 basic 
anchors: 
 They create or add significant value to a customer or end user. 
 They do so by solving a significant problem, or meeting a significant want or need, for which 
someone is willing to pay a premium. 
 They have a strong market, profit margin. 
 They are a good fit with the founders and management team. 
 They have strong risk/reward proposition. 
At this stage, the team will concentrate mostly on the obvious benefits and limitations: 
 Does the idea appear to meet my goals? 
 What factors could prevent it from being successful? 
 Are the team members (or my family and I) prepared to make the sacrifices necessary to 
make this project work? 
It is difficult to remain totally objective through this stage. 
A healthy level of skepticism is required to allow the group to discover the warning signs and 
pitfalls that lie in wait to sabotage any good idea. 
Criteria considerations: 
 Are the benefits from this idea sufficient to justify the cost as measured in terms of finance, 
personal stress and family sacrifice? 
 What is the balance of benefits to cost that we are willing to tolerate? 
MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES 
Management experts agree that the most important factor for success by far in any business is the 
management team that makes the decisions, yet it is the factor most often overlooked in 
determining the feasibility of a venture. 
Criteria considerations: 
 What specific skills does the business need to develop or hire? 
 At what point does the lack of available skills become an obstacle? 
TECHNICAL REALITIES 
An assessment of the idea must consider the question, “Can it be done?” This question must be 
answered to determine whether the business has the capability of producing the product and taking 
it to the marketplace. Specific questions might include: 
 Do we have access to the required raw materials? 
 What technology, equipment and processes are required? 
 Do we understand the required technology, equipment and processes? 
 Does it appear that the production system is workable and affordable? 
Criteria considerations:
 How much time can I devote to this project at the expense of my other enterprises? 
 How much change am I prepared to make to accommodate this project? 
 At what point do I decide it is not worth the effort? 
MARKET REALITIES 
The success of any venture depends on the ability to get the right product into the right marketplace 
at the right time, and with the right price. 
The marketing world is littered with failed products that could have been successful if the formula for 
their offering had been different. Effective market research is the most important activity that an 
entrepreneur can undertake to reduce risk. 
Key areas to research: 
 Features and benefits of the product or service (Are the features we want to offer actually 
benefits for the potential customers?); 
 Target market (Who is most likely to buy?); 
 Distribution options (What is the best way to reach the target buyers?); 
 Market demand (How many possible buyers are there, at what volume and price?); 
 Competition (What products and companies compete in this market?); 
 Trends (What is the expected life of the product?); 
 Expected price (What are the potential highest, lowest and most often prices?); and 
 Expected sales (What volume and market conditions can we expect?). 
It is important to understand that customers rule the marketplace. 
They alone determine whether the product will sell in sufficient 
numbers and price to be viable. 
Market research can reveal the probability of product success. 
 Critical 
Thinking 
Criteria Considerations: 
 Is there demand? Is there enough demand to drive enough profit to be sustainable? 
 What are the minimum values on sales volume and price needed to be viable? 
 Is the potential for initial sales, and growth in sales, adequate? 
 Is this product the best option available to us? 
COST AND FINANCIAL REALITIES 
As each of the previous analyses has been conducted, the anticipated costs and expected returns
have been transferred to a ledger. From this ledger, three statements can be generated: 
1. Pro Forma (Projected) Income and Expense Statement 
2. Projected Cash Flow Statement 
3. Opening Balance Sheet 
These statements are essential to creating a solid business case to justify the proposed venture. 
In the original goals, a target for return on investment (ROI) might have been stated. It is possible 
to calculate a projected ROI. Your team is seeking answers to the following questions: 
 Does the profit level meet or exceed our goals? 
 Is the cost of establishment even within our range of financial options? 
 Overall, will this proposal provide sufficient return on investment? 
Criteria considerations: 
 Is the cost of sales acceptable relative to the likely product price? 
 Might the venture meet or exceed the profit goals? 
 Does the expected return meet or exceed the minimum acceptable level? 
RISK REALITIES 
Investments are made in the expectation of a return to the investor. In general, the greater the 
return expected, the more willing an investor will be to invest. 
People vary in their ability and their willingness to take risks. The ability varies with the extent of the 
required investment, and the wealth or asset value of the investor. The willingness varies with the 
amount of those assets that the investor or group of investors is willing to place at risk. These risks 
may be financial or social. In either case, they can have a significant effect on the project team and 
their families. 
Managing risk is a function of controlling the factors that contribute to possible losses against the 
investment. 
A feasibility analysis is a risk-management tool, because it helps the business identify the risk 
factors involved in the project. Other risk management tools are those practices that contribute to 
consistent quality and safety of the product being sold or that contribute to a low unit cost of 
production. 
The feasibility analyst might ask the following questions: 
 What can go wrong with this project? 
 Is there a way to prevent any of these from happening? 
 What is the probability that any of these factors will go wrong? 
 What is the probability that two or more of these will go wrong? 
 Can the effect of these risks be reduced through insurance, and at what cost? 
 How able and willing is the business to assume these risks? 
Risk control is the adoption of systems that minimize the likelihood and the effect of a 
negative occurrence. 
 Quality control and safety programs reduce the risk of injury or harm to customers 
 Production efficiencies provide a competitive advantage through low cost of production 
 Thorough market research provides an improved chance of marketplace success 
 Accurate cost estimates improve the accuracy of estimating profit and return 
General insurance agents carry insurance programs covering many kinds of business risks. These 
come at a significant cost to the business, so if more factors can be controlled through management 
and production, the cost of production will be lower. 
Criteria Considerations: 
 Do the risks involved in this venture exceed the benefits that I hope to gain? 
 What specific risks does the business need to avoid or control? 
 Is the cost of risk abatement through prevention and insurance affordable? 
 What is the maximum amount of risk that the business is willing to take? 
Venture Opportunity Screening Exercises (VOSE) 
The venture creation process requires performance of due diligence. The components of these 
exercises are used to channel your thought and data collection efforts toward creating the 
foundation for development of the complete Business Plan. Allow for a dynamic processing of each 
component and thereby the shaping of the opportunity and a plan to execute it. It is OK to be 
initially broad in your perspective and then become more focused in later iterations. 
At the end of the VOSE exercise, you should have a clear idea of the relative attractiveness of your 
opportunity. However, it is rarely simply cut and dried. Mostly, there will be considerable uncertainty 
and numerous unknowns and risks. Completing this exercise can, however, help you understand 
those uncertainties and risks as you make a decision about the business idea. 
The Venture Opportunity Profile 
Fill in this profile for each cooperative opportunity. Indicate for each criterion where the opportunity 
is located on the value continuum from low to high. Once you have evaluated the idea according to 
each of the criteria, you can determine its total score for each of the major categories.

Case Study 1 
Part 1: The Financial Case Study of Farmer Cooperative Inc. 
You have recently agreed to sit on the steering committee for a new local cooperative. The 
cooperative is to be a full service retailer of fuel, fertilizer and chemicals that is expected to compete 
with all the “players” in the market. The business will consist of a bulk fuel depot, with fuel delivery 
trucks, fertilizer handling facility and storage sheds, chemical storage sheds and a main plant office. 
The idea is the “Brain child” of a coffee shop group of producers who are frustrated with the price of 
key inputs on there own farms. Consideration has been given to a cooperative model to allow the 
profits to flow back to the members. 
The group of producers held a membership prospective meeting 4 months ago and was able to raise 
the funds to have a qualified consultant conduct a detailed feasibility study to consider all aspects of 
the potential business. 
Now you have been asked to review the 2nd and 3 year balance sheets, income statements and 
statements of cash flows from the feasibility study. The consultant has included comparative data 
from common sized cooperatives retailing similar products. You are expected to make a formal 
recommendations to the steering committee as to if the projections are realistic and achievable. 
The capital cost in year one is estimated at $22.5 million. By year 3 the cooperative is to have raised 
$22.287 million in Equity certificates, and have borrowed $10.677 million to fund operations. 
You Report to the Steering Committee should include: 
1.) Analysis of the Balance Sheet 
2.) Analysis of the Income Statement 
3.) Analysis of the Statement of Change 
4.) Compare year 2 & 3 with Common Size Operations 
5.) Recommendations to Proceed or Abandon

ARTICLE 7 - CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND NON-SOLICITATION
7.1 Conflict of Interest - Consultant covenants and agrees not to consult or provide any services

direct competitor of the Company for purposes of this Agreement is defined as any individual,

Articles 5, 6, or 7 of this Agreement will render irreparable harm to the Company, and that a remedy

to seek any and all equitable relief, including, but not limited to, injunctive relief, and to any other 
remedy that may be available under any applicable law or agreement between the parties. 
Consultant acknowledges that an award of damages to the Company does not preclude a court from 
ordering injunctive relief. Both damages and injunctive relief shall be proper modes of relief and are 
not to be considered as alternative remedies.

supersedes all prior discussions and understandings in respect to the subject of this Agreement, 
whether written or oral. 
9.4 Dispute Resolution - If there is any dispute or controversy between the parties arising out of 
or relating to this Agreement, the parties agree that such dispute or controversy will be arbitrated in

including reasonable attorney’s fees and expert’s fees, of all parties incurred in any dispute which is 
determined and/or settled by arbitration pursuant to this Agreement will be borne by the party 
determined to be liable in respect of such dispute; provided, however, that if complete liability is not 
assessed against only one party, the parties will share the total costs in proportion to their 
respective amounts of liability so determined. Except where clearly prevented by the area in 
dispute, both parties agree to continue performing their respective 
obligations under this Agreement until the dispute is resolved. 
9.5 Modification - No modification, termination or attempted waiver of this Agreement, or any 
provision thereof, shall be valid unless in writing signed by the party against whom the same is 
sought to be enforced. 
9.6 Waiver of Breach - The waiver by a party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement by 
the other party shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach by 
the party in breach. 
9.7 Successors and Assigns - This Agreement may not be assigned by either party without the 
prior written consent of the other party; provided, however, that the Agreement shall be assignable 
by the Company without Consultant’s consent in the event the Company is acquired by or merged 
into another corporation or business entity. The benefits and obligations of this Agreement shall be 
binding upon and inure to the parties hereto, their successors and assigns.
